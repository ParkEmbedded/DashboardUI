# What is Park Embedded?
Park is a Electron based operating environment for embedded systems, it functions like a normal desktop environment. However, it is designed to run web applications on top of the environment for Kiosks, POS Systems or Registers.

## To run the DE.
Requirements to run the Desktop Environment:
- Debian / Ubuntu based distro
- At least 4GB of free system memory

If you are a developer / tester and want to try it out, building "PDE" is simple, in your terminal; type ```sudo chmod +x ./autorun.sh && ./autorun.sh``` to start the installation, this will also install NODE & NPM as well as other depenencies.

Once the installer is done, type ```npm start .``` and you should see `Environment started, please wait...` and that is it! You have sucessfully ran the DE! If you have feedback to give me, please let me know.
